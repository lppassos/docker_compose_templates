# Docker Compose personal repository

Collection of my personal docker-compose configurations for different
technologies.

These repositories are setup for personal development use, with little
security or scalability concerns.

They are to be used in very basic development scenarios with very little load
just to get familiarized wiuth the various components involved in this type
of deployments.

They can also be used for experimentation on techniques where performance is
not a concern.
