# DNS Server Experiment

DNS server to map all hosts of localdomain.my to 127.0.0.1

It's tricky to configure it in the local windows environment due to being
put on port 1025.

I struggled to add it to the TCP-IP configuration due to the use of the strange port.

Something to revisit at a later date.
